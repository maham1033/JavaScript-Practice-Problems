// 1.Why doesn't this code work? Try to make it work and guess what the result will be (hint: this is a little bit of a review from last lesson).
const numberVariable = 0;

numberVariable++;
numberVariable++;
numberVariable++;

console.log(numberVariable);

// this code is not working becuase we are using const keyword.Remember if we want to re-assign the value we have to use let keyword
